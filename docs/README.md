![Alex UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Prateek2030s/ip/refs/heads/master/docs/Ui.png)

Alex is a friendly task assistant that helps you keep track of tasks via a simple chat-style interface. You can add three types of tasks, list and find them, mark/unmark completion, delete tasks, and even create your own aliases for commands.

---

## Features

- **Three task types**: `todo`, `deadline`, `event`
- **List tasks**: See everything youâ€™ve added
- **Find tasks**: Search by keyword
- **Mark / Unmark**: Track completion status
- **Delete tasks**: Remove items you no longer need
- **Aliases**: Create shorthand for any command, and view all aliases
- **Greetings & exit**: `hello` and `bye`

---
